	<blockquote>
		<p>Five philosophers, Aristotle, Kant, Spinoza, Marx, and Russell (the tasks) spend their time thinking and eating spaghetti. They eat at a round table with five individual seats. For eating each philosopher needs two forks (the resources). There are five forks on the table, one left and one right of each seat. When a philosopher cannot grab both forks it sits and waits. Eating takes random time, then the philosopher puts the forks down and leaves the dining room. After spending some random time thinking about the nature of the universe, he again becomes hungry, and the circle repeats itself.</p>

In this project, the Philosophers also have to sleep.

# Download, install and use

<div id=instal></div></a>To download and compile:

```git clone https://github.com/Mel-louie/42cursus.git && cd rank03_Philosophers/philo/ && make```

If everythings went fine, an executable (philo) has been created.

<div id=play></div>To lauch it:

```./philo [number_of_pholisophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]```

- number_of_philosophers: is the number of philosophers and also the numberof forks
- time_to_die: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesnâ€™t start eating [time_to_die] milliseconds after starting his last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it dies
- time_to_eat: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time he will need to keep the two forks.
- time_to_sleep: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spendsleeping.
- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat: argument is optional, if allphilosophers eat at least [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] the simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death of a philosopher

Examples:
``` ./philo 5 800 200 200```
or
``` ./philo 5 800 200 200 7```

<div id=bonus></div><b>BONUS</b>

In this version the specific rules are:
- All the forks are in the middle of the table.
- They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented bya semaphore.
- Each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher
